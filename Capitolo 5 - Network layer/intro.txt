The network layer is concerned with getting packets from the source all the way to the destination. Getting to the destination may require making many hops at intermediate
routers along the way. This function clearly contrasts with that of the data link layer, which has the more modest goal of just moving frames from one end of a (virtual)
‘‘wire’’ to the other. Thus, the network layer is the lowest layer that deals with END-TO-END TRANSMISSION.

1)To achieve its goals, the network layer must learn about the TOPOLOGY of the network (i.e., the set of all routers and links) and compute appropriate paths through it, even
for large networks. 2)It must also take care when choosing routes to avoid overloading some of the communication lines and routers while leaving others idle. 3)Finally, when
the source and destination are in different independently operated networks, sometimes called autonomous systems, new challenges arise, such as coordinating traffic flows
across multiple networks and managing network utilization. These problems are typically handled at the network layer.

Network operators are often tasked with dealing with these challenges manually, through low-level configuration. More recently, however, the advent of software-defined
networking and programmable hardware has made it possible to configure the network layer from higher-level software programs, and even to redefine the functions of the
network layer entirely.
