Within a single building, LANs are widely used for interconnection, but most wide area network infrastructure is built up from
point-to-point lines. In Chap. 4, we will look at LANs. Here we will examine the data link protocols found on point-to-point
lines in the Internet in three common situations. The first situation is when packets are sent over SONET optical fiber links in
wide area networks. These links are widely used, for example, to connect routers in the different locations of an ISPâ€™s network.
The second situation is for ADSL links running on the local loop of the telephone network at the edge of the Internet. The third
situation is for DOCSIS links in the local loop of a cable network. Both ADSL and DOCSIS connect millions of individuals and 
businesses to the Internet.
