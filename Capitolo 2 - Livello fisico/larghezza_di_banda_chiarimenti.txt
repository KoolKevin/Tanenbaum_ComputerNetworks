There is much confusion about bandwidth because it means different things to electrical engineers and to computer scientists.
To electrical engineers, (analog) bandwidth is a quantity measured in Hz. To computer scientists, (digital) bandwidth
is the maximum DATA RATE of a channel, a quantity measured in bits/sec.

That data rate is the end result of using the analog bandwidth of a physical channel for digital transmission, and the two
are related, as we discuss next.
