In this chapter, we look at the lowest layer in our reference model, the physical layer. It defines the electrical, timing, and
other interfaces by which bits are sent as signals over channels. The physical layer is the foundation on which the network is 
built. The properties of different kinds of physical channels determine the performance (e.g., throughput, latency, and error rate)
so it is a good place to start our journey into network-land.
