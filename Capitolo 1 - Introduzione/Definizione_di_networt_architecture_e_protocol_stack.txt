DEF NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
A set of layers and protocols is called a Network Architecture. The specification of an architecture must contain enough information to allow an implementer to write the program or build
the hardware for each layer so that it will correctly obey the appropriate protocol. Neither the details of the implementation
nor the specification of the interfaces is part of the architecture because these are hidden away inside the machines 
and not visible from the outside. 

DEF PROTOCOL STACK
A list of the protocols used by a certain system, one protocol per layer, is called a Protocol Stack. Network
architectures, protocol stacks, and the protocols themselves are the principal subjects of this book.
