DEF INTERNET
A collection of interconnected networks is called an internetwork or internet. We will use these terms in a generic sense, in contrast to
the global Internet (which is one specific internet), which we will always capitalize. The Internet connects content providers, access
networks, enterprise networks, home networks, and many other networks to one another.
    An internet entails the interconnection of distinct, independently operated networks. In our view, connecting a LAN and a WAN or 
connecting two LANs is the usual way to form an internetwork.

DEF GATEWAY
The device that makes a connection between two or more networks and provides the necessary translation, both in terms of hardware and
software, is a gateway. Gateways are distinguished by the layer at which they operate in the protocol hierarchy. We will have much more
to say about layers and protocol hierarchies in the next section, but for now imagine that higher layers are more tied to applications,
such as the Web, and lower layers are more tied to transmission links, such as Ethernet.
    Because the benefit of forming an internet is to connect computers across networks, we do not want to use too low-level a gateway or
we will be unable to make connections between different kinds of networks. We do not want to use too high-level a gateway either, or the
connection will only work for particular applications.
    The level in the middle that is ‘‘just right’’ is often called the network layer, and a router is a gateway that switches packets
at the network layer. Generally speaking, an internetwork will be connected by network-layer gateways, or routers; however, even a single
large network often contains many routers.
