CONNECTION-ORIENTED/CONNECTION-LESS SERVICES
Layers can offer two different types of service to the layers above them: connection-oriented and connectionless. 
Connection-oriented service is modeled after the telephone system. To talk to someone, you pick up the phone, dial the number,
talk, and then hang up. Similarly, to use a connection-oriented network service, the service user first establishes a connection,
uses the connection, and then releases the connection. The essential aspect of a connection is that it acts like a tube: the sender pushes objects
(bits) in at one end, and the receiver takes them out at the other end.  In most cases the order is preserved so that the bits
arrive in the order they were sent. A circuit is another name for a connection with associated resources, such as a fixed bandwidth.
    In contrast to connection-oriented service, connectionless service is modeled after the postal system. Each message (letter)
carries the full destination address, and each one is routed through the intermediate nodes inside the system independent
of all the subsequent messages. Normally, when two messages are sent to the same destination, the first one sent will be the first
one to arrive. However, it is possible that the first one sent can be delayed so that the second one arrives first (no ordine).

RELIABILTY
Each kind of service can further be characterized by its reliability. Some services are reliable in the sense that they 
NEVER LOSE DATA. Usually, a reliable service is implemented by having the receiver acknowledge the receipt of each message
so the sender is sure that it arrived. The acknowledgement process introduces overhead and delays, which are often worth it
but are sometimes undesirable.
