Many link-layer communications protocols that we studied in Chap. 3 rely on a broadcast communication medium to transmit data.
Any such protocol requires additional mechanisms to allow multiple senders to efficiently and fairly share the broadcast medium.

In any broadcast network, the key issue involves determining who gets to use the channel when there is competition for it. For
example, consider a conference call in which six people, on six different telephones, are all connected so that each one can hear
and talk to everyone else. It is very likely that when one of them stops speaking, two or more will start talking at once, leading
to chaos. In a face-to-face meeting, chaos is often avoided by a second external channel. For example, at a meeting, people raise
their hands to request permission to speak. When only a single channel is available, it is much harder to determine who should go
next. (In the literature, broadcast channels are sometimes referred to as multiaccess channels or random access channels).

The protocols used to determine who goes next on a multiaccess channel belong to a sublayer of the data link layer called the MAC
(Medium Access Control ) sublayer. The MAC sublayer is especially important in LANs, particularly wireless ones because wireless is
naturally a broadcast channel. Some aspects of a WAN (e.g., a direct interconnect) are point-to-point; others (e.g., the shared
access network in a cable ISP) are shared and also rely on the MAC layer to facilitate sharing.

(Technically, the MAC sublayer is the bottom part of the data link layer, so logically we should have studied it before examining
all the point-to-point protocols in Chap. 3)
