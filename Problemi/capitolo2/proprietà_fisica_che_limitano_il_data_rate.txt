Q1) Identify three physical properties that limit the maximum data rate of digital communication channels used in practice.

In digital communication channels, the maximum data rate is fundamentally constrained by three key physical properties:
    - bandwidth,
    - signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
    - propagation delay and attenuation.
Here‚Äôs how each of these factors limits data transmission:

1) Bandwidth
Bandwidth refers to the range of frequencies that a communication channel can support. It is typically measured in Hertz (Hz).
According to the NYQUIST THEOREM, for a noiseless channel, the maximum data rate (in bits per second) is directly proportional
to the bandwidth of the channel. Specifically, the maximum data rate ùëÖ_max is given by:
 
    ùëÖ_max = 2*Bandwidth*log_2(ùëÄ); Where ùëÄ is the number of discrete signal levels used.

In practice, however, all real-world channels have some noise, which limits the practical data rate to less than the theoretical
maximum. A higher bandwidth allows more data to be transmitted per unit time, but this is limited by the physical medium's
ability to carry higher frequencies and by regulations.

2) Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is the ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the background noise. It is often expressed
in decibels (dB). According to SHANNON'S CAPACITY THEOREM, the maximum data rate ùê∂ of a channel, which is also known as the channel 
capacity, is given by:

    ùê∂ = Bandwidth*log_2(1 + S/N); Where S/N is the signal-to-noise ratio.

Higher SNR allows for a higher data rate because the signal can be more easily distinguished from noise. In practical terms,
as noise increases, more sophisticated (and slower) error-correcting codes may be required to ensure accurate data transmission,
effectively reducing the usable data rate.

3) Propagation Delay and Attenuation
The real world channel capacity encompasses several factors, including propagation delay and attenuation, which can also limit
the data rate.
    - Propagation delay is the time it takes for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver. If the delay is significant,
      it can lead to longer waiting times for acknowledgments in certain protocols, reducing the overall throughput.
    - Attenuation refers to the loss of signal strength as it propagates through the medium. Over long distances,
      signals can become weaker, which requires either amplification or retransmission, both of which introduce delays
      and potential errors, reducing the effective data rate.
In high-speed digital communications, managing these aspects becomes critical because they directly influence how fast data
can be reliably transmitted and received.
