Q1) Compare the delay in sending an x-bit message over a k-hop path in a circuit-switched network and in a (lightly loaded)
packet-switched network. 
    - The circuit setup time is (s) sec,
    - the propagation delay is (d) sec per hop,
    - the packet size is (p) bits,
    - and the data rate is (b) bps.
Under what conditions does the packet network have a lower delay?
Also, explain the conditions under which a packet-switched network is preferable to a circuit-switched network. 

1) Circuit-Switched Network:
In a circuit-switched network, the delay can be broken down into three components:
    - Circuit Setup Time (𝑠): Before data transmission can begin, a dedicated circuit must be established across the 𝑘 hops.
    - Transmission Delay: Once the circuit is established, the entire 𝑥-bit message is sent at the data rate 𝑏.
    - Propagation Delay: As the message traverses each hop, it experiences a propagation delay of 𝑑 seconds per hop.
Thus, the total delay 𝐷_circuit in a circuit-switched network is:

    𝐷_circuit = 𝑠 + x/b + d*k; con (k) numero di hop

2) Packet-Switched Network:
In a packet-switched network, the message (x bits) is divided into packets, each of size 𝑝 bits. The delay for each packet includes
the transmission delay for that packet and the propagation delay for each hop.
    - Number of Packets: The message is divided into 𝑛 packets, where 𝑛 = 𝑥/𝑝.
The total delay 𝐷_packet​ for the packet-switched network can be approximated by considering the transmission and propagation delay
for the first packet plus the time it takes to send the remaining packets:

    𝐷_packet = 𝑘*(𝑝/𝑏 + 𝑑) + (𝑛−1)*𝑝/𝑏
​
To determine under what conditions the packet-switched network has a lower delay, we compare the two delays:
    
    𝐷_circuit > 𝐷_packet    ->     s > b/p*(k−1)

This inequality shows that the packet-switched network will have a lower delay if the circuit setup time 𝑠 is greater than 𝑝/b*(𝑘−1).
This condition indicates that for a packet-switched network to be preferable in terms of delay, the overhead of setting up a
dedicated circuit must be significant compared to the per-packet transmission time over multiple hops.
